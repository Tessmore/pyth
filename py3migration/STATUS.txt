as of 2015-06-28:

I have made the code nearly python2/python3-duocompatible by calling
python-modernize.
Comitted.

I have inserted requires = ['six'] into setup.py
Not committed.

I have then repaired many of the bytes-vs-str issues in 
pyth\plugins\rtf15\reader.py.
Dito for pyth\plugins\xhtml\writer.py.
The former in particular was tricky because most strings have to be handled
as bytestrings -- but not all of them.
See  http://pythonhosted.org/six/

These two now appear to work correctly for simple RTF files (without
images, tables, headers etc).
Complex files remain to be tested.

I have established a set of system-level test cases,
with various input files with the relevant RTF features
(paragraphs, line breaks, page breaks, various characters, fonts,
 bold, italics, underline, hyperlink)
and coming from MS Word, Wordpad, OpenOffice.
They are handled correctly (as per comparison with how
MS Word 2013 shows them) with one exception.

TO DO:

- For tests/rtfs/zh-cn, the conversion produces some additional
text that is not shown in MS Word 2013.
The RTF is very complicated, so I am not sure whether this is
a defect or maybe the RTF is incorrect (but even then...).

- Introduce proper handling of itemized lists (well, that is a
new feature actually).

- Debug the other plugins.
